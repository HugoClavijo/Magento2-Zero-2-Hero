<p>For the Nike Women's Training Spring 2012 collection, we asked Nike athletes and trainers to examine the way they train and look for the commonalities in their range of motion. Our designers then used innovation and design to develop a collection of footwear and apparel that enhances each one of the 6 CORE MOVES by providing zero distraction and technological details that are hidden in the beauty of a unique design aesthetic.</p>

<p>The soft, cozy pre- and post-workout garment that will keep you comfortable during your warm up and cool down. Made from Dri-FIT single-knit, plated jersey fabric (a combination of organic cotton, recycled polyester and spandex), it wicks sweat away from your skin helping to keep you comfortable and warm. A cropped body, loose fit, open neckline, raglan sleeves, flat-seam construction (to reduce chaffing) and a gusset that runs all the way from the body to the sleeve hem allow for a full and free range of movement. But it&rsquo;s also fitted where needed, with a ribbed collar, waistband and cuffs maintaining a snug, efficient fit that won&rsquo;t leave it flapping about and getting in your way. A fashionable bleach-splattered design and color options that include blue, pink and soft grey alongside the traditional black, means it also looks great.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s made from a lightweight fabric blend with a ribbed texture and hugs the contours of the body, flattering your shape. An open mesh panel down the back provides an interesting design feature, but also allows ventilation and, for exercises such as yoga where correct posture is key, a window for the instructor to check alignment. In spite of its softness and lightness, it still offers support for a variety of low-impact gym activities with a hidden internal shelf bra. The longer length, sitting just below the hip, helps prevent the top from riding up, preserving your modesty and making you less self-conscious when performing squats and lunges or rotating.</p>

<p>The tight, seamless fit helps support the muscles and flatters the figure. At the back, the waistband is ribbed to keep it in place and tilted up for a natural fit helping to give you reassurance that you won&rsquo;t be exposed when bending and stretching. It also features a mesh panel for extra ventilation; this can also be used to help guide hip alignment, essential for exercises such as pilates. The lightweight fabric blend feels soft and luxurious but efficiently wicks sweat away from the skin during even a tough workout, helping to keep you dry and minimizing irritation. No seams also mean less chance of chaffing. A ribbed hem on the capris leg keeps it in place so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about distractions as you power your legs through a demanding workout.</p>

<p>Skinny adjustable elastic straps, pulled into a racer back arrangement, free up the shoulders for the maximum range of arm movements. Smart touches minimize irritation: the neckline and armholes are hemmed with a soft elastic binding and side seams moved further round towards the back of the bra. Support is provided by a lined internal shelf bra, which works in conjunction with the adjustable straps, making the Nike Indy Strappy Bra ideal for low-impact training. The Nike Indy Reversible Strappy Bra comes in a range of bold colors with a large swoosh on the reverse side, making it a fun and comfortable workout choice.</p>

<p>The main front body is made of soft Dri-FIT stretch jersey fabric (cotton, polyester and spandex mix) and the reverse of Dri-FIT mesh (polyester and spandex) for extra ventilation. The racer-style back is generously scooped out for fluid curves (picked out by the contrasting hem), slim straps and maximum freedom for the shoulders during moves such as push and pull as well as when rotating. A mesh back ventilation panel, in a contrasting color, accentuates the muscular lines of the bra. Smart touches minimize irritation: the neckline and armholes are hemmed with a soft elastic binding and side seams moved further round towards the back of the bra. The snug-fitting lined internal shelf bra offers invisible light support for low-impact training.</p>

<p>These eye-catching shorts consist of two layers, which work together for comfort, freedom of movement, and sweat management. The outer short is a Dri-FIT taffeta fabric (a polyester and spandex mix) that wicks sweat away to the surface of the short and dries quickly. This fabric also has a two-way stretch for an athletic fit and a side hem vent that keeps legs unrestricted when performing core moves such as the Lunge or Bend. The inner compression short and gusset is a soft Dri-FIT stretch-jersey fabric (polyester and spandex mix in a contrasting color) which wicks sweat away from the skin. Design features such as the elastic waistband and external drawcord ensure a snug, secure fit, lying flat on the body for a more flattering silhouette, while the flat seam construction reduces chaffing.</p>

<p>The established Nike Pro apparel uses the Dri-FIT technology which wicks sweat away from the skin to the surface of the garment to help keep you dry and minimize irritation during tough workouts, and incorporates flat-seam construction to help reduce irritation caused by chaffing. For Spring 2012, the weight of the stretch jersey fabric (a polyester and spandex mix) has been increased to make it more robust allowing it to be worn as an outer layer as well as under team uniforms. The compression fit of the pants offers great support, with a secure elastic waistband and internal gusset for comfort. The range includes the 18.5 inch capris, funky 2.5-inch short print, bright and bold 5-inch short. These are complemented by the racer-style Nike Pro Bra, which offers freedom of movement while using its compression fit and nylon stabilizers in the bra straps to provide the level of support needed for a medium-impact training session that might involve running, and multidirectional movement.</p>

<p>A flattering V-neck top that creates an elegant slimline silhouette. The Dri-FIT stretch-jersey fabric (polyester and spandex mix) hugs the body but also wicks sweat away from the skin keeping you cool, dry and comfortable. The positioning of the side seams keeps the top streamline and simple and the longer body not only elongates the look, but also keeps your rear covered when you Bend or Squat. Raglan sleeves allow arms and shoulders to move freely in moves such as the Pull while an underarm gusset and flat seam keep you comfortable. Tops come in an extensive range of block colors, with a subtle Nike swoosh on the breast. Attractive on its own, this slim-fit top is also great for layering with a jacket or team uniform.</p>

"Learning to Love Again",learning-to-love-again,outdoor,,"<p><span>When I began the trail, I knew that I would miss the regular physical contact that I had with people in sedentary life. Everything from high fives, fist bumps, hugs, and handshakes &ndash; I would miss it all. Little did I know how strange and how hard it would be to feel love without that simple physical contact. Disclaimer &ndash; you might want to read up on the 5 love languages if you&rsquo;re slightly confused about what I am talking about. </span></p>
<p><span>A simple Google search should suffice. While on trail, besides ticks and bears, the thing that hikers fear most is Norovirus &ndash; imagine having a stomach bug for three days and not being able to eat anything while losing it all. Being a virus, it is spread through human contact with anyone or anything that is infected or has come into contact with it. For this reason, among others, you don&rsquo;t shake hands, high five, fist bump, give hugs, and you make sure to actively avoid contact if possible. Being someone who feels love through those simple interactions, it was so strange for me to not shake people&rsquo;s hands when I met them or to congratulate people with hugs or high fives. </span></p>
<p><span>It felt was as though I was being isolated from people even though I was in close proximity with them every day. The good news is that physical contact isn&rsquo;t the only love language. I found myself trying to love others and to be loved in ways that were not my primary languages. Whenever someone did trail magic, not only did I feel overjoyed, but there was a deeper sense of appreciation and gratitude that made me feel cared for and loved. If someone threw my bear line for me, I would feel the same thing &ndash; something deeper than service and gifts.</span></p>
<p><span> I see how the other love languages are more active in my life and think about how the trail isn&rsquo;t just teaching my legs how to do big miles, or my brain to spend time in silence and though, but that it is changing me. It is changing the way that I can be loved and how I can adapt to be loved in almost every situation. As someone wise once wrote, &ldquo;these three remain &ndash; faith, hope, and love, but the greatest of these is love&rdquo;.</span></p>",wysiwyg/blog/blog02.jpg,,"When I began the trail, I knew that I would miss the regular physical contact that I had with people in sedentary life.

<p>The soft, cozy pre- and post-workout garment that will keep you comfortable during your warm up and cool down. Made from Dri-FIT single-knit, plated jersey fabric (a combination of organic cotton, recycled polyester and spandex), it wicks sweat away from your skin helping to keep you comfortable and warm. A cropped body, loose fit, open neckline, raglan sleeves, flat-seam construction (to reduce chaffing) and a gusset that runs all the way from the body to the sleeve hem allow for a full and free range of movement. But it’s also fitted where needed, with a ribbed collar, waistband and cuffs maintaining a snug, efficient fit that won’t leave it flapping about and getting in your way. A fashionable bleach-splattered design and color options that include blue, pink and soft grey alongside the traditional black, means it also looks great.</p>
<p>Nike Seamless long bra</p>
<p>A seamless skin that maximizes breathability and sweat management while minimizing chaffing, irritation or chunky straps that might impede movement.</p>
<p>It’s made from a lightweight fabric blend with a ribbed texture and hugs the contours of the body, flattering your shape. An open mesh panel down the back provides an interesting design feature, but also allows ventilation and, for exercises such as yoga where correct posture is key, a window for the instructor to check alignment. In spite of its softness and lightness, it still offers support for a variety of low-impact gym activities with a hidden internal shelf bra. The longer length, sitting just below the hip, helps prevent the top from riding up, preserving your modesty and making you less self-conscious when performing squats and lunges or rotating.</p>

At the back, the waistband is ribbed to keep it in place and tilted up for a natural fit helping to give you reassurance that you won’t be exposed when bending and stretching. It also features a mesh panel for extra ventilation; this can also be used to help guide hip alignment, essential for exercises such as pilates. The lightweight fabric blend feels soft and luxurious but efficiently wicks sweat away from the skin during even a tough workout, helping to keep you dry and minimizing irritation. No seams also mean less chance of chaffing.

You know the sort of scenario: suspicions raised when the tooth fairy forgets to come, or St Nicholas commits a wrapping-paper infraction visible only to a nosey eight-year-old.</p>
<p>Or when, as happened this week, it turns out that the big brands we know and trust have been having a giggle behind our backs. Ahead of an official report into misleading offers, a number of our leading supermarkets have announced they are to discontinue multi-buy deals. It turns out that bogofs &ndash; buy one, get one free offers &ndash; are a false economy, making us fork out on average over &pound;1,000 more a year than we planned. A supermarket aisle Tesco, Asda, Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Ocado were all found to be offering misleading deals CREDIT: ALAMY I wish I had filmed my teenage daughter at the moment she discovered that the supermarket (OUR supermarket!) had been tricking us! Us! Its loyal customers! Who shop there all the time! The conversation went something like this. Me: &ldquo;Can you fetch me a pack of mushrooms, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her: &ldquo;Here you go,&rdquo; dropping carton into the trolley. Me: &ldquo;Not those ones, the others are cheaper.&rdquo; Her: &ldquo;Durr, no they&rsquo;re not. Compare the prices?&rdquo; Me: &ldquo;Durr, compare the weights? And then compare the prices?&rdquo; Shopping trolley with food in it Buy one get one free deals cause shoppers to spend &pound;1000 more a year than they planned.

Off.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, darling, it&rsquo;s not almost like that,&rdquo; I soothed. &ldquo;It is exactly like that.&rdquo; ""While there is no suggestion that Google has broken any law by paying such frankly trivial back taxes, it highlights that the law is too complex, and that it allows too much wriggle room."" &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not fai-ai-air!&rdquo; she wailed.</p>

<p>No beep means caving in and keying in the code. Of course, that&rsquo;s no great hardship, but it takes time, and when the checkout has a whole load of people waiting in line, it&rsquo;s no fun for anyone.</p>
<p>But thanks to engineers at Japanese electronics company Toshiba, those days may soon be over. They&rsquo;ve come up with a scanner that can recognize items &mdash; no bar code required.

<p><a href=""http://icdn7.digitaltrends.com/image/object-recognition-scanner-2-1440x916.jpg?ver=1""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-338290"" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"" src=""http://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/object-recognition-scanner-2-625x397.jpg?ver=1"" alt="""" width=""625"" height=""397"" /></a></p>
<p><a href=""http://icdn7.digitaltrends.com/image/object-recognition-scanner-2-1440x916.jpg?ver=1""></a>Toshiba&rsquo;s Keiichi Hasegawa explained that although the special scanner is able to recognize any supermarket item, it will be particularly useful when it comes to fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Fruit and vegetables in supermarkets don&rsquo;t usually have bar codes because they&rsquo;re put out while they&rsquo;re fresh, so these items can&rsquo;t be read at the register using bar codes, which means staff need to input data to record them,&rdquo; Hasegawa said. &ldquo;If staff are part-time employees, they may not recognize some items, which can cause delays. We&rsquo;re developing this new scanner to solve that problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The technology is so advanced that it goes well beyond simply telling the difference between an apple and an orange. Toshiba&rsquo;s Object Recognition Scanner can tell your Red Delicious from your Pacific Rose, and your Cortland from your Wealthy &mdash; great news if you work in a supermarket and don&rsquo;t happen to be an apple aficionado.</p>
<p>Toshiba is currently in the process of creating a database of typical supermarket items and is also fine tuning the scanner so that it will avoid causing any of those long, drawn-out item-waving moments.</p>",wysiwyg/blog/supermarket_2.jpg,,"We all get stuck at the supermarket checkout from time to time when the assistant can’t get an item’s bar code to scan. We’re left watching in awkward silence as the flustered employee waves the item every which way, upside down, back and forth, at an angle, until they’re left literally rubbing it on the scanner in the vain hope that the machine will do us all a favor, recognize that it’s a loaf of bread and beep.",1

<p></p>
<p>Like the Snapdragon 820, the 821 is a quad-core chip based on the custom Kryo cores. The 810 was octa-core, based on the ARM reference Cortex-A57 and A53. With the 820 (and now 821), the four Kryo cores operating at varying clock speeds can offer better performance without as much heat. The Snapdragon 821 will come in clock speeds as high as 2.4GHz compared to the 2.15GHz for the 820. Maybe that's the entire basis of Qualcomm's 10% improvement claim.</p>

"What's New on Your Supermarket Shelf?",what_s_new_on_your_supermarket,grocery-gourmet,,"Health, convenience prime concerns for consumers

Last year's hottest supermarket craze -- low-carb products -- can be found in this year's clearance aisle. In a country obsessed with dieting, we've seen low-fat, fat-free, sugar-free, low-carb, and no-carb foods come and go with little impact on our girth. In fact, as a nation, we're heavier than ever.

So what new foods can you expect to see next on your supermarket shelves? WebMD asked the experts for their predictions on the latest trends.

As with most everything else, baby boomers are affecting how the nation eats, according to the NPD Marketing group. Boomers made their mark with fast food in the '60s, fern bars in the '70s, microwaves in the '80s, take-out in the '90s, and a trend toward healthier foods today, according to Harry Balzar, NPD's vice president. As the boomers age, they are coping with health and weight concerns that drive their eating patterns.

But boomers aren't the only ones behind changes in food buying habits.

""Increasing Latin populations have had an enormous impact on our food trends,"" says supermarket guru Phil Lempert, editor of the Facts, Figures and the Future newsletter. ""They don't drink sodas with high-fructose corn syrup, and their diets are more abundant in fruits, vegetables, and fresh foods.""",wysiwyg/blog/gro-blog01.jpg,,"Last year's hottest supermarket craze -- low-carb products -- can be found in this year's clearance aisle.
